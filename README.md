* NPCs
* Locations
* Opposition (Villains, Monsters)
* Items


### Connective Tissue 
These are {secrets, mysteries, rumors, clues, legends}. This is information that matters to the characters.

Most importantly they are the connective tissue between your adventures (monsters, locations, items, npcs, etc).
